And let's face it, committing <a href="https://www.educatorstechnology.com/2023/05/the-10000-hours-rule-why-hard-work-is.html" target="_blank"><b>10,000 hours</b></a> to become a world-class developer in a specific area? That's a whole different level of dedication! ðŸ˜…

Recently, I had the pleasure of diving into David Epstein's captivating book, <a href="https://davidepstein.com/the-range/" target="_blank"><b>"Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World"</b></a> Let me tell you, it was an eye-opener! It got me thinking about the key to success and how I, as an Engineer can enhance my skill set for the future. Today, I want to share my experiences and insights on the topic of "range and skill development" from the perspective of a software engineer who has managed to not just survive but thrive over the past three years. The best part? These findings aren't limited to the realm of IT. They can be applied to various areas and job roles as well. Join me on an exciting journey of growth and professional development!

## Range

What exactly does 'Range' mean? In essence, Range refers to the 'breadth of knowledge,' encompassing a wide range of knowledge and experience. Epstein emphasizes the importance of expanding the breadth of our knowledge and experiences.

In his book, Epstein highlights the significance of expanding our knowledge and exploring different areas. By doing so, we have the opportunity to discover our <b>unique 'matching quality'</b>, which refers to the intersection of our skills and interests with the needs of the world. Through repeated trials and errors, we can uncover our own 'matching quality.' Epstein suggests that learning occurs not through extensive planning, but through <b>active experimentation and taking action</b>. 

In general, I share the belief that being a generalist is key to achieving success. Personally, I as an IT specialist find it beneficial to <b>prioritize identifying a specialization</b> and building a strong knowledge base before branching out into other domains overtime. In my personal experience, I embarked on my journey with an e-commerce startup, where I honed my skills in web development and digital marketing. Building on that experience, I transitioned into the role of a digital analyst in an agency and delved into learning Python programming along with the fundamentals of data engineering.

As I continued to explore different areas, I discovered a genuine passion for DevOps engineering. It became evident to me that this field possessed my unique matching quality - a combination of productivity and enjoyment in my work, particularly in deploying infrastructure components, creating data pipelines, managing cloud security, and automating the deployment process of software applications. Embracing DevOps has allowed me to leverage my existing skills and knowledge while diving into a new and exciting domain.

## Continuous learning

During my learning journey, I made it a habit to set daily small goals and diligently work on them step by step. I discovered that <a href="https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps" target="_blank"><b>Developer Roadmap</b></a> provides a wealth of role-based roadmaps filled with comprehensive skills and expertise. It's truly a goldmine for beginners. 

Every day, I dedicated myself to completing the roadmap assignments while leveraging resources such as books, YouTube, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning to expand my knowledge.ðŸ¤“ If you're looking to learn DevOps, I highly recommend checking out the website <a href="https://kodekloud.com/" target="_blank"><b>KodeKloud</b></a>.

## Soft Skills
Up until this point, I have primarily discussed hard skills. Broadly speaking, skills can be categorized into two types: hard skills and soft skills. As an IT Engineer, there is initially a greater emphasis on acquiring hard skills. However, to evolve into a successful software engineer, it is equally crucial to master soft skills. Within the realm of software development, triumph hinges on <b>effective teamwork</b>, characterized by collaboration, communication, a shared vision, and collective effort, which leads the way to success.Occasionally, it is necessary to persuade your Product Owner (PO) or team members, simplify intricate technology stacks, and provide guidance and mentorship to fellow developers.

## The developer shapes
The concept of developer shape models is valuable for considering the career growth of developers. These models provide a framework to understand and develop unique skills. By embracing models like <b>T-shaped </b>or <b>I-shaped</b>, engineers can cultivate a wide range of skills while specializing in specific areas. This enables them to grow professionally and contribute effectively in different situations, setting them apart from their peers.

<img src="/images/post-20230613/developer-shape-model.png" alt="developer shape model" style="border: 1px solid  gray;">

A T-shaped developer refers to someone with deep knowledge and specialization in one area (the vertical bar of the T), complemented by a broad understanding of various related disciplines, while the I-shape signifies deep expertise in a specific area. Depending on your specific situation, you can choose to scale up (vertical scaling for I) or scale out (horizontal scaling for T) your knowledge. 

One of the remarkable aspects of continuous learning is that as you accumulate knowledge, your learning speed increases exponentially. You can apply your existing knowledge to grasp new concepts more effortlessly, enabling you to continuously expand your expertise at an accelerated pace. Striking a balance between breadth and depth of skills can greatly benefit a software engineer's career growth and adaptability to different projects and teams. In general, large enterprises seek specialists with strong skill sets, while small companies and startups seek all-rounders with diverse and wide-ranging skill sets.

### Step 1 - Acquiring I-shape knowledge with scale up

Let's consider my own example: when I could only write Python code, I was an I-shaped developer. I began filling out a section of the skill hex chart to gain a comprehensive understanding of the job requirements. Focused on learning specific Python frameworks used in data engineering and familiarizing myself with their main functionalities. Following this process, I expanded my knowledge to similar frameworks for each aspect. This approach enabled me to quickly evaluate whether I found the data engineering field appealing before investing significant time in mastering all its facets.

## Donâ€™t waste your time
<img src="/images/post-20230613/pareto-principle.png" alt="scale out as a devops engineer" style="border: 1px solid  gray;">

Time is money. Avoid wasting time. It is important to focus on mastering approximately 80% of the skills with 20% of the effort, rather than striving for 100% performance. The main challenge in learning is the limited time and misplaced priorities. With our time constraints, it is crucial to learn effectively and embrace the <b>non-linear nature </b>of the learning process, considering the rapid evolution of technologies. If you feel confident in your understanding of a topic at around 80%, it is beneficial to shift to a new topic, with the intention of revisiting the previous one when you identify knowledge gaps.

## Follow tech trends
It is also important to be aware of the current stage of technology trends (such as AI, Blockchain, web3, AR, and VR) before considering a switch to another industry or job. The diffusion of innovation model, represented by a bell curve, illustrates the five stages of market adoption: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Understanding these stages can help you gauge the level of market acceptance and determine the potential opportunities and risks associated with emerging technologies.

<img src="/images/post-20230613/innovations.png" alt="scale out as a devops engineer" style="border: 1px solid  gray;">

In the tech world of 2023, sectors like VR and AR are still considered early adopters, as the usage and development of these technologies are not as widespread compared to mobile apps or web2 technology. The AI industry, thanks to advancements like OpenAI, is currently experiencing significant hype and is positioned in the next trend stage (early majority). On the other hand, container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes have reached the late majority stage and have become the de facto standards for software development today.

The advantages of learning innovator or early adopter technologies are that you could become a pioneer and have the opportunity to shape and influence these technologies. However, there are also disadvantages to consider. These technologies can be challenging to incorporate due to limited documentation and a small community. Additionally, there is a risk that the technology may not sustain in the long run and could potentially be replaced by another emerging technology.
