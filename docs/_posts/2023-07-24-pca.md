Hey there, fellow Prometheus enthusiasts!


As part of my preparation, I created a list of sample exam questions. These not only gauged my progress but also highlighted areas where I needed to improve. I made it a point to review my answers thoroughly, learning from my mistakes and solidifying my understanding of the Prometheus ecosystem. It was specially helpful to utilize AI Chats for asking mock questions or simular topic questions and delving deeper into the topic.

Furthermore, I highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/prometheus-up/9781492034131/" target="_blank"><b>"Prometheus: Up & Running"</b></a> as an essential resource to comprehend all the vital topics of Prometheus. Gaining proficiency in PromQL and queries was greatly aided by reading the informative posts from <b>"PromLabs"</b> and referring to the <a href="https://promlabs.com/promql-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank"><b>"promql-cheat-sheet"</b></a>.


Good luck to everyone, happy learning and happy exam-taking!ðŸ¤ž
