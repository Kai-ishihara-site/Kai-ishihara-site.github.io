Hey there, I was recently presented with the chance to collaborate on crafting architectural diagrams using the <a href="https://c4model.com/" target="_blank"><b>C4 Model</b></a> in my workplace and want to demonstrate how to create a software architecture diagram using the C4 model, and also guide you through implementing diagrams as code using the tool "Structurizr CLI".

## ‚ö° Tl;dr
- The C4 model is a simple way to diagram software architecture with 4 diagram types
- This model is a hierarchically visualizing of software architecture for technical and non-technical users
- C4 = Context, Container, Component, Code
- The C4 model and Structurizr CLI tool are created by Simon Brown

## üí° What is the C4 Model?
Software architecture diagrams are great for showing how you're planning to create a software system (early design) or how a software system already works (looking back to document, share knowledge, and learn). However, it's highly likely that most of the software architecture diagrams you've come across appear to be a chaotic arrangement of boxes and lines. And you can quickly lose the overall understanding of the software architecture. 

UML or ER models might not be easier to understand, and not all team members like product owners, data scientists, or external engineers need to know all the details. Therefore, the C4 model comes into play for all audiences aiming to showcase important software components catering to their diverse skills and varying interests.

## üîé Abstraction First, Notation Second!

Simon emphasizes, "We're engineers, not artists. Having a shared set of abstractions matters more than having a shared notation." I completely agree with his perspective. If your goal is to amaze your colleagues with complex symbols, charts, and technical language, you might unintentionally produce complicated diagrams that hinder communication due to their complexity. However, if your aim is for your colleagues to grasp the entire system architecture, it's better to begin with a high-level perspective and gradually delve deeper, gradually uncovering the finer details.

## üèóÔ∏è Mock Project "CNK"
To gain a better understanding, let's explore these 4 models using my dummy project, Cloud Native Kiosk (CNK). Here, we have two main users: "customer" and "owner," who purchase and manage kiosk products. If you're interested in cloud-native development, <a href="https://github.com/yuyatinnefeld/cloud-native-kiosk" target="_blank"><b>CNK</b></a> project could pique your interest.


## üó∫Ô∏è C4 Model Diagrams
We begin by establishing the simplest level of abstraction, Level 1Ô∏è‚É£ Context Diagram for the system.

##### Level 1Ô∏è‚É£ Context Diagram
<img src="/images/post-20230810/level-1-system-context-diagram.png" alt="c4 model system diagram" style="border: 1px solid  gray;"></br>

The online store is accessible to two user groups: "customer" and "owner." The web interface interacts with two backend services, namely the "customer system" and the "shop admin system." Level 1, which is a system context diagram, displays the software you're creating and how it connects with the outside world, including the people who use it and the other software it works with.

#### Level 2Ô∏è‚É£ Container Diagram
<img src="/images/post-20230810/level-2-container-diagram.png" alt="c4 model container diagram" style="border: 1px solid  gray;"></br>

The customer can use the SPA service, built using JavaScript and Angular. This service connects to a Backend Application created with Golang and Gin. Customer data is stored in MySQL DB. On the other hand, the kiosk owner accesses a different application developed with Python and Flask, linked to the Flask Backend Service. Kiosk items are stored in a PostgreSQL DB. Level 2, a container diagram, provides a closer look at the software system, revealing the individual containers (such as applications, database, microservices, etc.) that together form the software system.

#### Level 3Ô∏è‚É£ Component Diagram
<img src="/images/post-20230810/level-3-component-diagram.png" alt="c4 model component diagram" style="border: 1px solid  gray;"></br>

Now, the focus shifts from these two users to two services "SAP Shop" and "Web Application". You can see the intricate logic of both containers as "components", and there's an extra component called "security-component" (HashiCorp Vault) visible as well. Level 3, known as a component diagram, goes deeper into an individual single container to display its internal parts. These parts should match actual sections in your codebase, like groups of code.


#### Level 4Ô∏è‚É£ Code Diagram
<img src="/images/post-20230810/level-4-code-diagram.png" alt="c4 model code / uml diagram" style="border: 1px solid  gray;"></br>

Finally, you will zoom in on a single part to see how it's made. Level 4 diagram gives specific details about how each part is created. We can utilize class diagram with UML or Entity Relationship to show how the code looks.


## üöÄ C4 Model as Code
Diagram as Code is gaining popularity as a method for illustrating software architecture for enduring high-level documentation. Here you can see how fast and simple it is to make diagrams using Structurizr Lite with Docker.

##### 1. Create a new directory
```bash
mkdir new-project && cd new-project
```

##### 2. Create a diagram via browser editor
- https://structurizr.com/dsl

##### 3. Create a file workspace.dsl in the directory

```
workspace {

    model {
        customer = person "Kiosk Customer" "A customer of the kiosk with a personal account"
        owner = person "Kiosk Owner" "An owner of the kiosk with an admin account"

        softwareSystem = softwareSystem "Online Shop System" "Allows customers to create an account, select kiosk items and make payments"

        customer -> softwareSystem "Uses"
        owner -> softwareSystem "Uses"

    }

    views {
        systemContext softwareSystem "Level-1" {
            include *
            autoLayout
        }

        theme default
    }

}
```

##### 4. Docker run

```bash
ABSOULT_PATH=$(pwd)
docker pull structurizr/lite
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $ABSOULT_PATH:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/lite
```

##### 5. Open the workspace by heading to localhost:8080
